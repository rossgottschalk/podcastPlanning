# podcastPlanning


In my typical subscibed podcast feed, when I'm searching for a particular podcast, I look for the cover art instead of reading the actual name. 

It's quicker for me to associate the artwork of the podcast instead of the actual title label. (often, the title of the podcast in inside the artwork)

The pocketCasts.png is much a much more appealing way for me to view my podcasts rather than the traditional built-in podcast app.
For starters, it just looks more appealing. Also, using a collection display like pocket casts was allow me to see more podcasts at one time. I don't want to have to scroll all the way down to see if I have a new episode of a particular podcast.

When selecting of a specific podcast, I'm a fan of how Overcast shows their detail screen. Their settings tab is especially easy to read.

I would suggest a collection view for the subscribed screen.
Within the detail view of a specific pod, I like the idea of having a table view that change change the contents within the table, depending on which section is selected. Just how overcast look.
